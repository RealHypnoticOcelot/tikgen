# TikGen
###### Designed to be used with [VidSplitter](https://github.com/RealHypnoticOcelot/vidsplitter


## How to use:
Install the same dependencies used with VidSplitter with the following command:

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Drag your equally-spaced videos into the same folder as the .py file. If you used VidSplitter, they should be named 1.mp4, 2.mp4, etc..
The program relies on this naming system, so please do not change it.

```python
python3 tikgen.py
```
Answer the prompts it gives you, and the script will output your Tik-Ready files in the same directory!
