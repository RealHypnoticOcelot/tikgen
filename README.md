# TikGen
###### Designed to be used with [VidSplitter](https://github.com/RealHypnoticOcelot/vidsplitter)


## How to use:
Install the dependencies required with the following commands:

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

And install imagemagick at [imagemagick.org](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php).
If you're on MacOS and have brew installed, you can just run `brew install imagemagick`.

Drag your equally-spaced videos into the same folder as the .py file. If you used VidSplitter, they should be named 1.mp4, 2.mp4, etc..
The program relies on this naming system, so please do not change it.

```python
python3 tikgen.py
```
Answer the prompts it gives you, and the script will output your Tik-Ready files in the same directory!

## Current Feature List:


- Add subtext to the videos

- Select a folder of videos for the background

- Make the videos loopable, with configurable loop speeds
